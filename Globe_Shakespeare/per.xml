    <lb/>It hath been sung at festivals,
    <lb/>On ember-eves and holy-ales;

    <lb/>Have read it for restoratives:

    <lb/>May to your wishes pleasure bring,
    <lb/>I life would wish, and that I might
    <lb/>Waste it for you, like taper-light.
    <lb/>This Antioch, then, Antiochus the Great
    <lb/>Built up, this city, for his chiefest seat;
    <lb/>The fairest in all Syria,
    <lb ed="G" n="20"/>I tell you what mine authors say:          
    <lb/>This king unto him took a fere,
    <lb/>Who died and left a female heir,
    <lb/>So buxom, so blithe, and full of face,
    <lb/>As heaven had lent her all his grace;
    <lb/>With whom the father liking took,
    <lb/>And her to incest did provoke:
    <lb/>Bad child; worse father! to entice his own
    <lb/>To evil should be done by none:
    <lb/>But custom what they did begin
    <lb ed="G" n="30"/>Was with long use account no sin.        
    <lb/>The beauty of this sinful dame
    <lb/>Made many princes thither frame,
    <lb/>To seek her as a bed-fellow,
    <lb/>In marriage-pleasures play-fellow:
    <lb/>Which to prevent he made a law,
    <lb/>To keep her still, and men in awe,
    <lb/>That whoso ask'd her for his wife,
    <lb/>His riddle told not, lost his life:
    <lb/>So for her many a wight did die,
    <lb ed="G" n="40"/>As yon grim looks do testify.            
    <lb/>What now ensues, to the judgement of your eye
    <lb/>I give, my cause who best can justify.

<sp who="first-fish."><speaker>First Fish.</speaker> 
<p>Alas, poor souls, it grieved my

<sp who="third-fish."><speaker>Third Fish.</speaker> 
<p>Nay, master, said not I as

<lb/>I look to be washed.   Master, I marvel how
<lb n="30"/>the fishes live in the sea.                    </p></sp>
<sp who="first-fish."><speaker>First Fish.</speaker>
<p>Why, as men do a-land; the

<lb/>our rich misers to nothing so fitly as to 
<lb/>a whale; a' plays and tumbles, driving the poor
<lb/>fry before him, and at last devours them all
<lb/>at a mouthful: such whales have I heard on

<lb/></l><l>The stages of our story. Pericles
<lb/></l><l>Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,
<lb/></l><l>Attended on by many a lord and knight,
<lb/></l><l>To see his daughter, all his life's delight.
<lb/></l><l>Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late
<lb/></l><l>Advanced in time to great and high estate,
<lb/></l><l>Is left to govern. Bear you it in mind,
<lb/></l><l>Old Helicanus goes along behind.
<lb/></l><l>Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought
<lb/></l><l>This king to Tarsus,--think his pilot thought;
<lb/></l><l>So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on,--
<lb/></l><l>To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.

<lb/></l><l>See how belief may suffer by foul show!
<lb/></l><l>This borrow'd passion stands for true old woe;
<lb/></l><l>And Pericles, in sorrow all devour'd,
<lb/></l><l>With sighs shot through, and biggest tears o'ershower'd,
<lb/></l><l>Leaves Tarsus and again embarks.   He swears
<lb/></l><l>Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:
<lb/></l><l>He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears
<lb/></l><l n="30">A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears, 
<lb/></l><l>And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit

<lb/></l><l>By wicked Dionyza.

<lb/><l>Hail, Dian! to perform thy just command,
<lb/></l><l>I here confess myself the king of Tyre;
<lb/></l><l>Who, frighted from my country, did wed
<lb/></l><l>At Pentapols the fair Thaisa.
<lb/></l><l>At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth
<lb/></l><l>A maid-child call'd Marina; who, O goddess,
<lb/></l><l>Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus
<lb/></l><l>Was nursed with Cleon; who at fourteen years
<lb/></l><l>He sought to murder: but her better stars
<lb/></l><l>Brought her to Mytilene; 'gainst whose shore
<lb/></l><l>Riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,
<lb/></l><l>Where, by her own most clear remembrance, she
<lb/></l><l part="I">Made known herself my daughter.</l></sp>
